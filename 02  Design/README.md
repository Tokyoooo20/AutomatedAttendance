# Automated Attendance Tracking System

A secure and scalable web-based Attendance Tracking System designed to streamline attendance management using barcode scanning, role-based access control (RBAC), and multi-factor authentication (MFA). This project facilitates registration, tracking, and reporting of student attendance via a cloud-deployed architecture.

## üìå Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate access for Admins, Instructors, and Students.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Instructors can scan barcodes to track attendance.
- **Attendance Reports**: Admins can generate detailed attendance reports.
- **Student Portal**: Students can view their attendance records.
- **Secure Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for added security.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deployed on scalable cloud infrastructure.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Expo.js** Single Page Application (SPA)
- Interfaces for Instructors (scanning), Students (viewing), and Admins (management)

### Backend
- **Spring Boot REST API**
- Implements business logic, security, and CRUD operations

### Database
- **MySQL** or **MongoDB Atlas** (Cloud-hosted)
- Collections for Users, Devices, Attendance Logs, Courses, and Audit Trails

## üîÅ Data Flow

1. **Registration**: Admin registers students and instructors; data and ID photo stored in DB.
2. **Attendance Tracking**: Instructor scans barcode; system validates and logs timestamp.
3. **Student View**: Students log in to view their attendance.
4. **Reporting**: Admin generates summaries from attendance logs.
